# Paperless at home

This instance is not connected to the internet and wont be connected to it. Thus the included secret is sort of bad, but not
exactly relevant.

## backup

It is done locally on a NAS system.

In case of a restore I should be able to clone this repo, pull the images and restore the files
into the data directory.
